A simple discord app that allows you to set up ranked-choice voting polls (AKA the alternative vote).
For polls with multiple winners, it uses the Single Transferable Vote (STV).

To set up a poll, use the command `/newpoll [name] [choice1] [choice2] ... [time limit] [description] [winners]`.
The arguments are the poll name, choices, time limit (in hours), description, and number of winners.

To get a ballot for a poll, use the button that shows up when the poll is created, or use the command
`/getballot [name]`.

To close a poll manually, use the the button that shows up when the poll is created, or use the command
`/closepoll [name]`.

For those unfamiliar, a ranked choice vote works like this:
	- Check if any candidate has more than 50% of the vote -> they win
	- Check if there is only one remaining candidate -> they win
	- Otherwise, eliminate the candidate with the least votes and redistribute those votes to
	  the 2nd ranked choice
	- Repeat until a winner is determined
